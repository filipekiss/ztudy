# Ztudy

So I [was told I should blog] about ZSH. Since I haven't managed the time to get
a blog up and running, I've decided to create this repository to share the
little of what I know about ZSH.

ZSH resources are usually manpages or stack overflow questions that are 8 years
old or a few hours of googling away. Since I've been using ZSH for nearly 10
years and I've banged my head against the wall a few times, I've decided I
should gather all those tricks I usually google for every time I need to use
them in one place and organize them.

My main goal is to collect a lot of info on ZSH and create guides that are easy
to read instead of searching 4 hours the `man zshexpn` on my computer to find
out what `${(iF)variable}` will do (Given that `variable` is an array, `(iF)`
will sort it case-insensitivity (that's the `i`) and join them using a `\n`
separator (that's the `F`)). The main problem I usually have with ZSH is with
resources that are out of date or in a format that's painful to read.
